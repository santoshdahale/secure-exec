## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Lazy Evaluation of Dynamic Imports
Dynamically imported modules (`import()`) SHALL be evaluated only when the import expression is reached during user code execution, not during the precompilation phase.

#### Scenario: Side effects execute at import call time
- **WHEN** user code contains `console.log("before"); const m = await import("./side-effect"); console.log("after")` where `./side-effect` logs "side-effect" on evaluation
- **THEN** stdout MUST contain "before", "side-effect", "after" in that order

#### Scenario: Conditional dynamic import skips unused branch
- **WHEN** user code contains `if (false) { await import("./unused"); }` where `./unused` logs "loaded" on evaluation
- **THEN** stdout MUST NOT contain "loaded"

#### Scenario: Repeated dynamic import returns same module without re-evaluation
- **WHEN** user code calls `await import("./mod")` twice, where `./mod` increments a global counter on evaluation
- **THEN** the counter MUST equal 1 after both imports, and both calls MUST return the same module namespace

### Requirement: Precompilation Without Evaluation
The precompilation phase SHALL resolve and compile dynamic import targets but MUST NOT instantiate or evaluate them.

#### Scenario: Precompiled module has no side effects before user code
- **WHEN** a module targeted by a static `import("./target")` specifier logs to console on evaluation
- **THEN** no console output from that module SHALL appear before user code begins executing

### Requirement: Async Dynamic Import Resolution
The `__dynamicImport` bridge function SHALL return a Promise that resolves to the module namespace, performing instantiation and evaluation on demand.

#### Scenario: Dynamic import resolves to module namespace
- **WHEN** user code calls `const m = await import("./mod")` where `./mod` exports `{ value: 42 }` as default
- **THEN** `m.default` MUST equal `{ value: 42 }`

#### Scenario: Dynamic import of non-existent module rejects
- **WHEN** user code calls `await import("./nonexistent")`
- **THEN** the returned Promise MUST reject with an error indicating the module cannot be resolved
